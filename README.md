Introduction to JavaScript

How to execute JavaScript?
JavaScript can be executed right inside oneâ€™s browser. You can open the JS console and start writing JS there.

Another way to execute JS is a runtime like Node.js which can be installed and used to run JavaScript code.

Yet another way to execute JavaScript is by inserting it inside the <script> tag of an HTML document.

What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used in web development. It is a client-side language, which means that it is executed by the user's web browser rather than the web server. This allows JavaScript to interact with the user and create dynamic, interactive web pages.

JavaScript is often used in combination with HTML and CSS to create web pages that are more interactive and engaging. It can be used to create all sorts of effects, such as drop-down menus, image sliders, and pop-up windows.

Getting Started with JavaScript
To start using JavaScript, you'll need a text editor and a web browser. There are many text editors available, such as Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, which are all popular choices among developers.

Once you have a text editor set up, you can start writing JavaScript code. To do this, you'll need to create a new file with a .js extension and then type your code into the file. You can then save the file and open it in your web browser to see the results.

What is ECMAScript?
ECMAScript is a standard on which JavaScript is based!

It was created to ensure that different documents on JavaScript are talking about the same language.
